A boy's mind works differently<br>
And a girl's mind also works differently<br>
The boys mostly love to play and fight<br>
The girls follow beauty tips and know what is wrong and right<br>
The boys like to see their super heroes fight with power<br>
The girls love to see the beauty of a flower<br>
A girl's and boy's mind works differently<br>
And in their own world they live contently.<br>

        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
