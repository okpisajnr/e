            A <em>boy's</em> mind <strong>works differently</strong><br>
            And a girl's mind also <em>works differently</em><br>
The boys mostly love to <em>play and fight</em><br>
The <em>girls<em> follow beauty tips and know <strong>what is wrong and right</strong><br>
The <em>boys</em> like to see their super heroes fight with power<br>
The <em>girls</em> love to see the beauty of a flower<br>
            A girl's and boy's mind works <em>differently</em><br>
            <strong>And in their own <em>world they live contently</em>.<strong><br>

        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
